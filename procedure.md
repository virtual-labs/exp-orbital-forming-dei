## Working Procedure of Orbital Forming

### 1. Preparation of Components
- All components are cleaned to remove oil, rust, and contaminants.
- The correct workpiece and tooling are selected based on required geometry.

### 2. Workpiece Positioning and Clamping
- The part is placed accurately in the fixture.
- Proper clamping is applied to ensure stability during the forming cycle.

### 3. Tool Head Alignment
- The orbital forming head is set at a small tilt angle (typically **3°–6°**).
- This angular setting enables progressive, localized deformation instead of direct vertical pressing.

### 4. Initiation of Forming Cycle
- The forming head begins rotating while gradually descending onto the workpiece.
- Contact occurs in a small, continuously moving zone, minimizing stress concentration.

### 5. Progressive Metal Flow
- As the tool orbits around the axis, controlled radial and axial deformation occurs.
- The material flows smoothly into the required shape—such as a **rivet head, flange, or collar**—without excessive force or heat generation.

### 6. Monitoring and Control
- Forming continues until predetermined parameters such as **height, diameter, and shape** are achieved.
- Stroke control or force sensors are often used to ensure accuracy and repeatability.

### 7. Cycle Completion and Part Removal
- Once the forming operation is complete, the tool retracts.
- Clamping is released, and the finished component is removed for inspection.

## Outcome
Orbital forming results in a **precise, smooth, and defect-free** formed head or flange with:
- Low forming forces  
- Excellent dimensional control  
- High repeatability
